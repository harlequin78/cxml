;; | Canonical XML
;; | =============
;; |                                      
;; | This document defines a subset of XML called canonical XML. The
;; | intended use of canonical XML is in testing XML processors, as a
;; | representation of the result of parsing an XML document.
;; | 
;; | Every well-formed XML document has a unique structurally equivalent
;; | canonical XML document. Two structurally equivalent XML documents have
;; | a byte-for-byte identical canonical XML document. Canonicalizing an
;; | XML document requires only information that an XML processor is
;; | required to make available to an application.
;; | 
;; | A canonical XML document conforms to the following grammar:
;; |
;; |    CanonXML    ::= Pi* element Pi*
;; |    element     ::= Stag (Datachar | Pi | element)* Etag
;; |    Stag        ::= '<'  Name Atts '>'
;; |    Etag        ::= '</' Name '>'
;; |    Pi          ::= '<?' Name ' ' (((Char - S) Char*)? - (Char* '?>' Char*)) '?>'
;; |    Atts        ::= (' ' Name '=' '"' Datachar* '"')*
;; |    Datachar    ::= '&amp;' | '&lt;' | '&gt;' | '&quot;'
;; |                     | '&#9;'| '&#10;'| '&#13;'
;; |                     | (Char - ('&' | '<' | '>' | '"' | #x9 | #xA | #xD))
;; |    Name        ::= (see XML spec)
;; |    Char        ::= (see XML spec)
;; |    S           ::= (see XML spec)
;; |
;; | Attributes are in lexicographical order (in Unicode bit order).
;; |  
;; | A canonical XML document is encoded in UTF-8.
;; |  
;; | Ignorable white space is considered significant and is treated
;; | equivalently to data.
